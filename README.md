CardFlare's development is currently paused. In the future I plan to rewrite CardFlare's LaunchOns as Ankidroid plugin. Nah i wont.
CardFlare is an opensource flashcard learning app for android that will force you to learn every time you open a certain app or turn on your phone. The alfa test versio  should be ready at the start of May. Or maybe next weekend depends on T3G.

i have made a basic logo will push it when i return home

I really need to think about documentation

Yeaah no one uses it not even me. As expected. Kinda sad
